	RE CHRIS NOTES:
		The backup file listing shows a lot of "Unknown" strings. Considering that some of the listings have seven unknowns, the information becomes muddled and difficult to read.
			Unknown should only be displayed for old backups (hopefully). Any suggestions on cleaning this up for backups that lack this data?
		PclZip issue
			Unable to replicate.
			This error is thrown here.  From your log this means that fopen must have returned a false for some reason for you.
				1953 if (($this->zip_fd = @fopen($this->zipname, $p_mode)) == 0)
				1954 {
				1955   // ----- Error log
				1956   PclZip::privErrorLog(PCLZIP_ERR_READ_OPEN_FAIL, 'Unable to open archive \''.$this->zipname.'\' in '.$p_mode.' mode');
				1957
				1958   // ----- Return
				1959   //--(MAGIC-PclTrace)--//PclTraceFctEnd(__FILE__, __LINE__, PclZip::errorCode(), PclZip::errorInfo());
				1960   return PclZip::errorCode();
				1961 } 
		After adding a destination, it appears that the only thing that happens is that the inputs empty. I have to scroll to the top of the dialog to see that something has actually happened. The same thing happens when modifying an existing destination except that the inputs do not clear out after submission. If the submission is to be handled by Javascript and not a fresh page load, then the page should be automatically scrolled to the top so that it is clear that the action did something.
			Unable to replicate. Forms submit without javascript and the action goes back to the same page with an anchor to the same tab so it should be going to the top.
		When selecting an existing remote destination, what if I want to use a different path? An option should allow for customizing the path without requiring modification of the remote destination (if the destination is used for backups and the user forgets to change it back after the migration, then their new site will start to fill with backups). The feature should support supplying new FTP information without creating a new destination.
			The entire remote destination system needs refactored and really needs to be done to make this doable without severe rigging.
			As a workaround I've added the ability to duplicate destinations for now until the destination system is redone.
		Backup listing actions inconsistent. For example clicking the backup filename on the migration page shouild start migration instead of downloading the archive. @see Chris' suggestions for handling this. - re: Chris

		Re-evaluate how this currently works to implement this. This would be helpful for guiding users.
	Capitalization in S3 bucket names seem to be ignored when copying. Not sure why this would happen yet. - re: Chris
	Magic migration:
		If sending to remote destination and the file already exists then don't overwrite without confirmation. @see Chris suggestions on handling this. - re: Chris

		Works great combined with the Note feature.

	FEATURE: Individual files can now be excluded from backups (no longer just directories!). Now listing files in exclusions navigator for easier exclusion of individual files.
		A few giant files clogging up your backups? Not only can you exclude entire directories but now you can also exclude individual files!

	mysqlbuddy updated to provide error message when mysql_query() returns false.
	Upgraded Amazon S3 library to 0.5.0.
	Added ImportBuddy favicon.
	FEATURE: Added Amazon S3 support for "Reduced Redundancy" class storage for a more affordable cloud storage option.

This can be accessed on the Server Information page by hovering over a table name in the list. This is a simple way to check and perform a basic repair.
	ImportBuddy upload feature no longer redirects back to login screen.

		Backups are organized within their own site folder for easy access.
		Manage your backups, delete, copy down to local, or get a direct download link good for an hour.
	FEATURE: PHP Max Execution time tester added (beta)
		Allows you to actually perform a test to determine your real tested maximum execution time allowed by your server. BackupBuddy attempts to override the execution time allowed to a very high number but almost all hosts cap the number much lower so the reported number can be far too high.  This test actually runs a script and keeps trask of the elapsed time to determine the actual maximum execution time limit of your server.
	FEATURE: Stash now supports multipart uploads (chunking uploads into pieces to allow larger files to be transferred in pieces over time).
		Extremely large files can now be transferred to Stash than could be before by breaking files up into 'chunks' and sending one piece at a time.

	Maximum PHP runtime no longer overriden if it is equal to 0 (unlimited) or greater than the number we would be changing it to (currently 7200 seconds).
