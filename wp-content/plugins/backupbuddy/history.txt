4.1.1.13 - 2013-10-04 - Dustin Bolton for Updater
	Enhancement: When releases with four version digits are released (such as 2.1.0.3), by default, the updater will not offer to update if just this last digit is updated. For instance, it will not automatically offer to update 2.1.0.1 to 2.1.0.3; rather, an automatic upgrade will become available when version 2.1.1 or greater is released. If you wish to force an update to these versions, you can add ithemes-updater-force-minor-update=1 to an admin page request (such as http://domain.com/wp-admin/index.php?ithemes-updater-force-minor-update=1) in order to force the updater make these releases available for an hour. If the update is not performed within the hour, the updater reverts back to default behavior.

Now it will appear at Settings > iThemes Licensing in the network admin Dashboard and at Settings > iThemes Licensing on sites when the current user is a network admin. This prevents exposing the licensing page to users that don't are not super users and thus should not be performing updates. As this update makes the functionality of the "Licensing Page Access" setting obsolete, the setting has been removed.

	OVERVIEW:
		This release focuses on improving core functionality to the next level on both the backup and restore side.  Performance, robustness, and usability have all been
		improved in this release.  This means that BackupBuddy and ImportBuddy are easier to use & understand as well as better handling larger sites better, especially
		large databases.  More advanced handling of problems and various fallbacks and intelligent checks (eg to handle .htaccess AddHandler issues) help to work around
		previous issues. If something does go wrong that cannot be worked around BackupBuddy or ImportBuddy will look at the situation and give contextually appropriate
		information to help you resolve the problem without having to seek outside help or reference.  Improved persistant logging helps track processes for
		troubleshooting if support is still needed.

	Changed setting to breakout large tables in commandline mode to enabled for better support of larger database tables.
	Changed default database dump method to PHP-based as it supports both table and row-based chunking & resuming.
	In Full Logging mode the backup state will be logged to the javascript console during backup for internal variable troubleshooting. (data in backup.php's $this->_backup var).
	Integrity check now checks that breakout table .sql files all exist.
	ImportBuddy: Fixed problem where sometimes cleanup step would be missing styling or graphics by using JS to load steps.
	sFTP destination: Fixed backup trying to send into incorrect path. First the path was changed into and then the file to upload included the path, resulting in doubling up of the path.
	Fixed typo in Dropbox description (multipark->multipart).
	Bug: Malware scan now using home_url() to calculate URL rather than site_url().
	Setup wizard now calculates which destinations are supported by server and provides all compatibility destinations as options. Eg Dropbox v2.
	BackupBuddy temp directory is now transient. Failed backups may result in it lingering longer until periodic housekeeping cleanup function removes it.
	Fixed incorrect background color when restoring a file from backup.
	File restore from backup now falls back to using copy/unlink combination when restoring files if rename() fails.
	Added note to not send complete log when seeking support unless requested and instead to send Status Log made during backups.

	When full error logging is enabled: Serial logging (eg from a running backup) is now directed to a separate log instead of the main for easier access and isolation.

	Flushing (flush() calls) can be disabled by setting the constant BACKUPBUDDY_NOFLUSH to TRUE in wp-config.php for rare server issue or troubleshooting.
	Fixed potential bug whereby ImportBuddy would seek out the DAT file in the root of the site before checking the temp subdirectory. This could result in using the wrong DAT file loading and thus an import failure with unexpected issues.
	Added warning suppression to php_uname() calls in zipbuddy to prevent warnings when generating server signature.
	Removed S3 key retrieval link as this is depricated due to secret keys no longer being supported.
	Backup steps view now lists steps taking less than 1 second as < 1 second rather than 0.
	Timed out backups are now examined for potential problems and their status updated appropriately to prevent 'hanging' timed out backups.
	Bug fix: Deleting a local backup after sending to a remote destination when chunking was enabled was not happening. Fixed.
	Fixed Server Tools page quick release links being reversed.
	Fixed additional temp directory exclusions missing trailing slash during generation.
	Bug: Malware scanner showed site_url() when it should be testing and showing home_url() results.
	Setup wizard now only shows destinations compatible with the server BackupBuddy is running on instead of all of them.
	View & restore of files from within an archive now use copy/unlink rather than rename to handle moving between different filesystems.
	ImportBuddy: Database backup restores no longer dump their contents into the site root for security and instead use a randomly named subdirectory to hold these temporary files.

	Now logging list_parts() response for S3 and Stash destinations for better troubleshooting of multipart send failures.
	WordPress cron schedules for scheduled backups are now periodically audited to check for duplicate schedules. If any are found they are removed. Inability to unschedule will log an error.
	Cron's destination_send() function now accepts an additional unique identifier to lock running so that the same transfer does not run multiple times due to cron issues. Upon cron.php destination_send() running, a file is created in the BB log directory named cronSend-UNIQUE_ID_HERE.lock if it does not exists with a string of 1 as the contents. If it already exists then the schedule has run more than once and the attempt will be logged with the attempt count and halted.
	ENHANCEMENT:
		Added additional API methods for calling by 3rd party plugins. See classes/api.txt for details. More documentation coming soon.

	Recently made backups and recently sent files can be viewed on those pages by clicking the new link to the right of the page title at the upper left of the page content.
