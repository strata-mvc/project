== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What sets this plugin apart from all the other Google Maps plugins for WordPress? =

There are a number features and functionality that set Google Maps Builder apart from the many WordPress Google Maps plugins. For starters, we promise this plugin will always have a light footprint. No extra tables or unnecessary overhead. Furthermore, the plugin is built from the ground up to be both easy and fun to use.

We have placed extra care and attention on the map creation process and are always looking to improve the UI with enhancements. It's our goal to integrate the plugin with the native WordPress admin UI without adding any distracting visuals. Finally, there are a number of additional features such as built in integration with Google Places API, Maps Icons and Snazzy Maps.

= Do I need a Google Places API Key to use this plugin? =

No. You do not need a Google Places API plugin to use this plugin.

= Does this plugin create any new database tables? =

Unlike many other Google Maps plugins, Google Maps Builder does not create a single new table in your WordPress database. There is no added database overhead or foreign MySQL queries. It's our guarantee that this plugin will never leave an orphaned table in your WordPress database.

= Where can I find the shortcodes for each map I create? =

You can find the shortcodes for each map on the post listing screen, within the post itself in the shortcode metabox (coming soon). Also coming soon: Map widget and TinyMCE button to include shortcode.

= What the heck is a shortcode and how do I use it? =

Google Maps Builder works by creating a plugin specific [WordPress shortcode](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode). Basically, you can copy the shortcode for a specific map and enter in into a widget or directly within content. As well, you can use the WordPress [do_shortcode()](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/do_shortcode) function to use it within your theme template files and even plugins.

= Does this plugin include a widget for displaying maps? =

Soon! For now, you can use the shortcode in the text widget. Soon there will be a Google Maps Builder Widget.

= How do I report a bug? =

We always welcome your feedback for improvements or if you have uncovered a bug. To report a bug please use the WordPress.org support forum.
